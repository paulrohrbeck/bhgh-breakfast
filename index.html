        <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> About</h2>

        <p>Join us at the “Success Starts With Hope” Breakfast for Boys Hope Girls Hope at the Olympic Club in downtown San Francisco.  This is a FREE breakfast for people to come and learn more about Hope Academy and the children we serve.  It is a fundraiser.  You will be asked to consider making a contribution at the event but you will not be required to give. As much as anything, we want you to come and find out about the profound impact Hope Academy has on the lives of the children-in-need in our community.</p>
        <p>To attend this event, please <a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a> and Anne Nguyen will follow up with you.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>Boys Hope Girls Hope San Francisco Bay Area (BHGH-SF Bay Area) is a <strong>college preparatory and life enrichment program</strong> that serves academically motivated young people in situations of significant need.  Since opening our doors in May 2000, we have helped dozens of young children—our scholars—who have the potential to succeed academically but often live in challenging situations and/or communities where the resources and attention to help them succeed are not available.</p>
        <p>Through our Hope Academy, a community-based program, we provide academic support and enrichment through a nurturing and structured environment and consistent and comprehensive care.  This approach maximizes their chances for a successful journey to—and through—college.  Importantly, 100% of our students come from families living at or below poverty line, and all of our collegians are the very first in their families to go to college.</p>
        <p>For more information, please visit our website at <a href="http://www.bhghsf.org">www.bhghsf.org</a>.</p>
